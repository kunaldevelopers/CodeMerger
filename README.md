# CodeMerger
Copy and paste this code into a Python file (e.g., merge_code.py), and then run it using a Python interpreter. The script will prompt you to enter HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and it will generate the merged code for you. Please note that this is a simple approach and may not handle all possible cases perfectly, but it should work for basic scenarios.
